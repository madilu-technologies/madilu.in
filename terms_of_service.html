            <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>

            <h3>Service Reliability and Unforeseen Circumstances</h3>
            <p>
              While Madilu Technologies is committed to providing reliable and
              secure healthcare technology services, we acknowledge that
              technology systems can be affected by various factors beyond our
              control. Despite our genuine efforts, comprehensive security
              measures, and adherence to industry best practices, unforeseen
              circumstances may occasionally occur, including but not limited
              to:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Server crashes and hardware failures</li>
              <li>Network outages and connectivity issues</li>
              <li>Cyber attacks and security breaches by third parties</li>
              <li>Natural disasters and force majeure events</li>
              <li>Internet service provider failures</li>
              <li>Power outages and infrastructure disruptions</li>
              <li>Software bugs or unexpected system behaviors</li>
              <li>Third-party service dependencies and failures</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitation of Damages</h3>
            <p>
              In recognition of the inherent risks associated with technology
              services and the critical nature of healthcare operations, the
              following limitations apply:
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h4>Exclusion of Liability</h4>
              <p>
                In no event shall Madilu Technologies, its officers, directors,
                employees, agents, or suppliers be liable for any damages
                whatsoever, including but not limited to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Loss or Corruption:</strong> Loss, corruption, or
                  unauthorized access to patient data, medical records, or other
                  healthcare information
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Service Interruption:</strong> Temporary or extended
                  downtime of software applications, platforms, or services
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Business Disruption:</strong> Interruption of
                  healthcare operations, delayed patient care, or workflow
                  disruptions
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Financial Losses:</strong> Direct or indirect monetary
                  losses, lost revenue, lost profits, or increased operational
                  costs
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consequential Damages:</strong> Any special,
                  incidental, punitive, or consequential damages arising from
                  service use or inability to use services
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This limitation applies regardless of the cause of action,
                whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability,
                breach of warranty, or any other legal theory, and even if
                Madilu Technologies has been advised of the possibility of such
                damages.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Industry Standard Practice</h3>
            <p>
              This limitation of liability reflects standard practice in the
              software and healthcare technology industry, recognizing that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Technology Inherent Risks:</strong> All technology
                systems carry inherent risks of failure that cannot be
                completely eliminated
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>External Dependencies:</strong> Software services depend
                on numerous external factors including internet infrastructure,
                third-party services, and environmental conditions
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasonable Precautions:</strong> Service providers
                implement reasonable security and reliability measures but
                cannot guarantee absolute protection against all possible risks
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Healthcare Criticality:</strong> While healthcare data
                and operations are critical, complete elimination of all
                technological risks is not feasible in current technology
                environments
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Maximum Liability Cap</h3>
            <p>
              To the extent permitted by applicable law, Madilu Technologies'
              total cumulative liability for all claims arising out of or
              related to the use of our services shall not exceed the total
              amount paid by the client to Madilu Technologies in the three (3)
              months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
            </p>

            <h3>Jurisdictional Variations</h3>
            <p>
              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
              certain types of damages or liability. In such jurisdictions, the
              above limitations may not apply, and Madilu Technologies'
              liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by
              applicable law.
            </p>

            <h3>Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Clients are encouraged to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintain regular data backups through independent means</li>
              <li>Implement appropriate business continuity plans</li>
              <li>Maintain adequate insurance coverage for their operations</li>
              <li>Follow recommended security practices and access controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exception for Gross Negligence</h3>
            <p>
              These limitations shall not apply to damages resulting from Madilu
              Technologies' gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violation
              of applicable law.
