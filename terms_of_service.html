                    <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Service Reliability and Unforeseen Circumstances</h3>
                    <p>While Madilu Technologies is committed to providing reliable and secure healthcare technology services, we acknowledge that technology systems can be affected by various factors beyond our control. Despite our genuine efforts, comprehensive security measures, and adherence to industry best practices, unforeseen circumstances may occasionally occur, including but not limited to:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Server crashes and hardware failures</li>
                        <li>Network outages and connectivity issues</li>
                        <li>Cyber attacks and security breaches by third parties</li>
                        <li>Natural disasters and force majeure events</li>
                        <li>Internet service provider failures</li>
                        <li>Power outages and infrastructure disruptions</li>
                        <li>Software bugs or unexpected system behaviors</li>
                        <li>Third-party service dependencies and failures</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Limitation of Damages</h3>
                    <p>In recognition of the inherent risks associated with technology services and the critical nature of healthcare operations, the following limitations apply:</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Exclusion of Liability</h4>
                        <p>In no event shall Madilu Technologies, its officers, directors, employees, agents, or suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever, including but not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Loss or Corruption:</strong> Loss, corruption, or unauthorized access to patient data, medical records, or other healthcare information</li>
                            <li><strong>Service Interruption:</strong> Temporary or extended downtime of software applications, platforms, or services</li>
                            <li><strong>Business Disruption:</strong> Interruption of healthcare operations, delayed patient care, or workflow disruptions</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial Losses:</strong> Direct or indirect monetary losses, lost revenue, lost profits, or increased operational costs</li>
                            <li><strong>Consequential Damages:</strong> Any special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages arising from service use or inability to use services</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This limitation applies regardless of the cause of action, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, or any other legal theory, and even if Madilu Technologies has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Industry Standard Practice</h3>
                    <p>This limitation of liability reflects standard practice in the software and healthcare technology industry, recognizing that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technology Inherent Risks:</strong> All technology systems carry inherent risks of failure that cannot be completely eliminated</li>
                        <li><strong>External Dependencies:</strong> Software services depend on numerous external factors including internet infrastructure, third-party services, and environmental conditions</li>
                        <li><strong>Reasonable Precautions:</strong> Service providers implement reasonable security and reliability measures but cannot guarantee absolute protection against all possible risks</li>
                        <li><strong>Healthcare Criticality:</strong> While healthcare data and operations are critical, complete elimination of all technological risks is not feasible in current technology environments</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Maximum Liability Cap</h3>
                    <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, Madilu Technologies' total cumulative liability for all claims arising out of or related to the use of our services shall not exceed the total amount paid by the client to Madilu Technologies in the three (3) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

                    <h3>Jurisdictional Variations</h3>
                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages or liability. In such jurisdictions, the above limitations may not apply, and Madilu Technologies' liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

                    <h3>Client Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>Clients are encouraged to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintain regular data backups through independent means</li>
                        <li>Implement appropriate business continuity plans</li>
                        <li>Maintain adequate insurance coverage for their operations</li>
                        <li>Follow recommended security practices and access controls</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Exception for Gross Negligence</h3>
                    <p>These limitations shall not apply to damages resulting from Madilu Technologies' gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of applicable law.</p>
